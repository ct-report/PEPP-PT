# PEPP-PT
Contact Tracing - PEPP-PT

Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing Framework. Centralized Architecture.

Initially supported by most European partners. However, several partners have withdrawn after the publication of the EPDB guidelines & the confirmation by Apple + Google that the new "Exposure Notification" APIs for BLE Contact Tracing won't support centralized architectures.

On April 26 only French Government is still supporting the development of a National Contact tracing app (STOPCOVID) based on PEPP-PT protocol (ROBERT/INRIA).

There are neither demo/public backend for test purposes nor available backend source code.

App source code is partially deprecated (old dependencies) and broken, since it's also missing the required Telemetry classes. 

Therefore, provided app-sample isn't fully-functional (disabled Telemetry + dummy Firebase instance).
